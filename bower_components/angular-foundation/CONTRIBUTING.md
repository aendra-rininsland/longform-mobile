We are always looking for the quality contributions and will be happy to accept your Pull Requests as long as those adhere to some basic rules:

* Please make sure that your contribution fits well in the project's context:
  * we are aiming at rebuilding Foundation directives in pure AngularJS, without any dependencies on any external JavaScript library;
  * the only dependency should be Foundation CSS and its markup structure;
  * directives should be html-agnostic as much as possible which in practice means:
        * templates should be referred to using the `templateUrl` property
        * it should be easy to change a default template to a custom one
        * directives shouldn't manipulate DOM structure directly (when possible)
